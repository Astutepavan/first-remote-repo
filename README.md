# Terraform AWS CloudWatch Metric Alarm Module

## Overview

This Terraform module simplifies the creation of CloudWatch Metric Alarms in your AWS environment. CloudWatch Metric Alarms are essential for monitoring various AWS resources and triggering actions based on predefined thresholds.

## Resources

This module creates a `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource that allows you to define and configure CloudWatch Metric Alarms.

## Usage

You can utilize this module by including it in your Terraform configuration. Below is an example of how to use the module:

```hcl
module "cloudwatch-metric-alarm" {
  source            = "path/to/module"
  alarm_name        = "ExampleAlarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
  evaluation_periods = 2
  metric_name       = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace         = "AWS/EC2"
  period            = 300
  statistic         = "Average"
  threshold         = 90
  alarm_description = "This is an example CloudWatch Metric Alarm."
  alarm_actions     = ["arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:ExampleTopic"]
  dimensions        = {
    InstanceId = "i-0123456789abcdef0"
  }
}
```
